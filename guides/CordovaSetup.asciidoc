== Setting up your development enivronment to use Apache Cordova

This tutorial covers setting up Apache Cordova, as well as the iOS and Android development environments, required to build the hybrid application.


=== Apache Cordova

In order to build a Cordova iOS app, you need to install CordovaLib, Cordova Framework and Cordova XCode templates. PhoneGap helpfully provide builds of Cordova 2.0.0.

We recommend you use the latest release, which is 2.0.0 at the time of writing. Download https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/zipball/2.0.0 and unzip.


=== iOS Build

In order to build a hybrid application for iOS, you'll need to install the iOS development environment:

* Mac OS X Lion (10.7) (or later)
* XCode 4.3 or later and the appropriate iOS SDK for your needs
* To test on iOS devices instead of the simulator:
** An Apple Developer account
** An iOS Development Certificate
** A provisioning profile for each device you plan to test with

You can read more about link:https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/GetToolsInstall/GetToolsandInstall.html[installing XCode and enrolling in the iOS Developer Program].

You'll also need Apache Cordova for iOs. It can be installed from the dmg in `lib/ios` in the PhoneGap 2.0.0 download.


=== Android Build

In order build a hybrid application for Android, you'll need to install the Android development environment:

* Java JDK 1.6
* Android SDK r17 starter package
* Eclipse Helios (3.6.2) (or later)
** Android Development Tools (ADT) Plugin for Eclipse
** Android SDK Tools r17 (included in the Android SDK starter package)
* At least the Android 2.3 SDK (installed via the Android SDK manager in the ADT)

The Android Developer site provides a link:http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html[step-by-step guide] to set up your environment.

Now, let's setup a Android Virtual Device in Eclipse. Clock on the AVD Button:

Click on New...

And then create the new AVD, giving it a name of your choice. You should have installed an Android 2.x or 4.0 SDK through the SDK manager (as part of the step-by-step guide above). You should choose this as your target when creating a virtual device.
