<h2>AeroGear Android</h2>
<p>AeroGear on Android simplifies developing mobile applications which connect to remote services.  We support all versions of Android above 2.3.3 ( and 2.3.3 if you include the support-library).  Aerogear Android is published in Maven Central and available as library project on Github.</p>
<p>All of the features of AeroGear are supported including DataStores, Pipes, Authentication, Authorization, and Pagination.  We also supply APIs for offloading the work done by Pipes to the Loader API; your Activities will crash less and use less bandwidth.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to hit us up on the mailing list or on irc.</p>
