## Push Notifications

The August release of AeroGear is focused around _Push Notifications_. Our client APIs got support for their matching platforms and two servers have been developed.

### One Server to rule them all

* Android and Google Cloud Messagin
* iOS and Apple Push Notification Service

Included in this release is a client implementation and polyfill for Mozilla's SimplePush specification as well as a client for the new AeroGear UnifiedPush server which allows easy management of push notifications across Android (GCM), iOS (APNS) and the web (SimplePush). We have also made some documentation improvements and added some new integration testing and continuous integration features.
