After Red Hat's acquisition of [FeedHenry](http://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-acquire-feedhenry-adds-enterprise-mobile-application-platform) the AeroGear team is excited to promote the first integration between FeedHenry and the AeroGear Unified Push Server!

In a detailed blog post John Frizelle from the FeedHenry team shows how to use FeedHenry's new [AeroGear MBaaS Integration Services](http://www.feedhenry.com/pushing-ahead-with-integrations/)


##Node.js integration

As John describes in the above blog, the heart of this integration is based on our [Node.js library](https://www.npmjs.org/package/unifiedpush-node-sender) for the UnifiedPush Server, which perfectly fits with FeedHenry's open and extensible architecture based on Node.js for mobile app development.
