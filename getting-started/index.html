  <p>AeroGear provides a suite of Mobile Services across a range of native (iOS & Android) and hybrid (Xamarin & Cordova) client SDKs that will simplify your mobile and modern application development needs, leveraging OpenShift's Container technology to provide a secure, scalable backend platform.</p>

  <p> These Services can be provisioned on demand from the OpenShift Service Catalog and allow developers to address a set of common mobile development challenegs with minimal overhead. Each Service has a corrisponding SDK module which is imported into your mobile app. These SDK modules provide connectivity to your back end services on OpenShift and perform the "heavy lifting" - allowing developers to focus on the buisness value of their mobile apps.</p>
