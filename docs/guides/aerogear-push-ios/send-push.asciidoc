Now you have the Sample App running on your phone, so it is time to use the _AeroGear Unified Push Server_ for delivering a _Push Notification_ message to your device!

== Simple Sender

A bit earlier you received a _pushApplicationID_ and a _masterSecret_ after the successful registration of the _Push Application_. These ID's  are used for sending a _broadcast_ message to all _registered_ devices (installations). Now, on a command line issue the following _CURL_ command:

[source,c]
----
curl -u "{pushApplicationID}:{masterSecret}"
   -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" 
   -X POST -d '{"alert":"Hello AeroGear Unified Push!"}'
   http://localhost:8080/ag-push/rest/sender/broadcast
----

The payload is simply a JSON map. You can send different key/value pairs, but be sure it is not too long, otherwise Apple does _NOT_ deliver the message to your phone. The _alert_ key is recoginzed by the _AeroGear Unified Push Server_ and translated into an APNs specific _alert_.


When the application is inactive, and a _Push Notification_ containing the _alert_ key is received by the device, a _Popup_ will show up, which displays the value of the _alert_ key:

**NOTE:** No custom code for this feature is required. It's build-in to _iOS Platform_.


== Custom Dialog

While the application is running, the above described feature is _NOT_ available. However, a different callback can be implemented on the _AppDelegate_ class:

[source,c]
----
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo {

    // A JSON object is received, represented as a NSDictionary.
    // use it to pick your custom key
    
    // For demo reasons, we simply read the "alert" key, from the "aps" dictionary:
    NSString *alertValue = [userInfo valueForKeyPath:@"aps.alert"];
    
    
    UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc]
                          initWithTitle: @"Custom Dialog, while Program is active"
                          message: alertValue
                          delegate: nil
                          cancelButtonTitle:@"OK"
                          otherButtonTitles:nil];
    [alert show];
}
----

The _application didReceiveRemoteNotification:_ method receives a _NSDictionary_ which represents a _JSON_ map, of the received payload. The _aps_ field of that map contains all the received attributes, like the earlier mentioned _alert_ key/value pair. The show code simply reads the value of the _alert_ key and explicitly displays it in a custom dialog. Of course, based on the needed functionality it would be also possible to update a view, based on the received message.


The custom Dialog:

== You are done

That's all you need to use the _AeroGear_ project for sending, and receiving _Push Notifications_ for an iOS device.

=== A final note

When using _Push Notifications_, have in mind that it's more for signaling and once in a while notifying a client. The app has to, by Apple's guidelines, function without receving _Push Notifications_. _Remember:_ The user could have disagreed after installing your app!
