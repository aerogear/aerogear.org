Google Related Setup
--------------------

Before the Android device is able to receive the notifications, you must authenticate yourself with Google as a developer. Luckily this is both easy and free to do, and doesn't require much set-up. Unlike iOS devices, you are able to test out your push notifications in either an emulator or on a real device.

Registering with Google
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, we must authenticate with Google. Google offers the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) platform, formerly known as Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM). You will need a Google Account for this.

- Firstly, you need to go to the https://code.google.com/apis/console/b/0/?pli=1[Google APIs Console] page.
- If you haven't created a project, click ``Create Project...''
- From the URL, grab the project ID (used later as the sender ID). This will be the numeric part of ``#project:*000000000000*''

- Next, you need to enable the GCM service, by going to ``Services'' and turn ``Google Cloud Messaging'' on.
- Finally, we must obtain the API key. Select ``API Access'', then ``Create new Server Key''
- You will need to whitelist at least one IP address for the sending server in order for the messages to not be rejected.

Preparing the Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prerequisites
- http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html[Android SDK]
- Google Cloud Messaging for Android Library (from SDK manager)
- Android emulator or device

Now that Google is ready to accept and deliver our messages, we need to create and enable our application to receive them.

*Now, we can link:../build-config[Configure the Build]*
