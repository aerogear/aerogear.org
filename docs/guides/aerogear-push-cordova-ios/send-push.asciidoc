Now you have the Cordova App running on your phone, so it is time to use the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ for delivering a _Push Notification_ message to your device!

== Simple Sender

A bit earlier you received a _pushApplicationID_ and a _masterSecret_ after the successful registration of the _Push Application_. These ID's  are used for sending a _broadcast_ message to all _registered_ devices (installations). Now, on a command line issue the following _CURL_ command:

[source,c]
----
curl -u "{pushApplicationID}:{masterSecret}"
   -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" 
   -X POST -d '{"alert":"AeroGear UnifiedPush and Apache Cordova 3.0.6", "badge":1}'
   http://localhost:8080/ag-push/rest/sender/broadcast
----

The payload is simply a JSON map. You can send different key/value pairs, but be sure it is not too long, otherwise Apple does _NOT_ deliver the message to your phone. The _alert_ key is recognized by the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ and translated into an APNs specific _alert_.


When the application is inactive, and a _Push Notification_ containing the _alert_ key is received by the device, a _Popup_ will show up, which displays the value of the _alert_ key:

**NOTE:** No custom code for this feature is required. It's build-in to _iOS Platform_.


== Custom Dialog

While the application is running, the above described feature is _NOT_ available. However, in this case the ++ JavaScript function will receive the message:

[source,javascript]
----
// handle the incoming APNS notifications for iOS
function onNotificationAPN(e) {
    // display the push notification message... (extract the APNs alert key value....)
    alert(e.alert);
}
----

This is how it looks when running on the device:

== You are done

That's all you need to use the _AeroGear_ project for sending, and receiving _Push Notifications_ for an iOS device.

=== A final note

When using _Push Notifications_, have in mind that it's more for signaling and once in a while notifying a client. The app has to, by Apple's guidelines, function without receiving _Push Notifications_. _Remember:_ The user could have disagreed after installing your app!
