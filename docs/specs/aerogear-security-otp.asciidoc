AeroGear Security OTP Specification
-----------------------------------

This is a initial proposal on having a two factor authentication layer
on mobile applications.

Cryptography Specification]

Scenarios - v0.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Random Generation*: _secrets are generated randomly at provisioning
stage and must be stored immediately and kept secure during their life
cycle. - RFC 4226_

Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installing the application, the user will be able to create your
own account. Before the HTTP request is sent to the server, mobile
application applies a key derivation function which generates the secret
shared key (SHA-1, SHA-256 or SHA-512) based on
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898[RFC 2898]:

_Secret shared key: user data + time + interval_

Where:

* user data: login, password
* time: current time (UTC)
* interval: represents the time in seconds, since the elapsed time.

The secret key will be stored on device for the calculation of a
one-time password value. When the first request comes to the server it
runs the same algorithm to generate the secret, store it and validate
the OTP.

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After a user has entered the login and password, mobile application will
retrieve the secret from storage for the OTP calculation and send it
back to the server. The server will retrieve the secret locally and
validate the OTP.

Scenarios
~~~~~~~~~

*Deterministic Generation*: _secrets are derived from a master seed,
both at provisioning and verification stages and generated on-the-fly
whenever it is required. - RFC 4226_

Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This scenarios aims to describe a common workflow for JavaScript aplications
and can also be provided to native clients

TOTP as a password-based key derivation (password + OTP)

Common questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* How it will affect Android, iOS and JavaScript projects?

These libraries are optional and not a requirement.
