/installation/macos-options.asciidoc
229 use slave instead of node???

/admin/digger-monitoring.asciidoc
2 when? suggestion: The Nagios instance performs (regularily) a number of checks:

/admin/using-http-proxy
29 use xref??
37 pod? to maintain consistency. Or is there a "tool" per se?
HTTP Proxy Usage Limitations: Can we refer to some other documentation regarding this(which tools may cause problem, pointing to their docs, etc.)


- macOS vs Mac, use 1 variation - macOS
- macOS machine vs macOS server - use one,                      

- asciidoc naming, for example, 
  "installing-plugins" is very ambiguous
  "known-issues" also,
  It is true that the folder the doc is contained in gives some info about what is inside the doc, but if we want to migrate to modular documentation, i think this can help
  e.g. longer, more descriptive names:
    use-http-proxy - is very undescriptive, even for editor, is it a directive to use http proxy?
    correction: using-http-proxy   
    
- should widely used terms such as:
  .Ansible Playbook
  .Jenkins Plugin
  etc. be CAPITALISED?
