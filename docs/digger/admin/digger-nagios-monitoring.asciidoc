== Digger Nagios Monitoring
Nagios is provisioned by default by the Digger Ansible playbook. Once Nagios is successfully installed, a number of checks are triggered by the playbook:

* Check that the Android PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) is Bound
* Check that the macOS server is running is accessible by Jenkins
* Check that the Jenkins instance is running

The URL and credentials for accessing the Nagios instance will be provided when the Ansible job has completed its provisioning.
