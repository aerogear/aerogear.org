== Installing Jenkins plugins
NOTE: Plugins for Jenkins can be found at https://plugins.jenkins.io

Digger will by default install a number of Jenkins plugins required for its proper operation. If more Jenkins plugins are required, they can be installed by including them as a task in Ansible playbook or using the Jenkins UI.

=== Using Ansible Playbook
https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-digger-installer/blob/master/configure-buildfarm/defaults/main.yml[Digger Installer Ansible playbook^]. 
The `jenkins_plugins` play can be modified to include new plugins. 

.The structure of a sample Ansible task:
[source,yaml]
----
-
  name: sample-plugin
  version: 1.20
  archive: http://updates.jenkins.io/download/plugins/sample-plugin/1.20/sample-plugin.hpi
----

=== Using Jenkins UI
Go to `Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins`. If the plugin is not available in the
`Available` tab then it   can be installed by uploading an `.hpi` file in
`Advanced -> Upload Plugin`.
