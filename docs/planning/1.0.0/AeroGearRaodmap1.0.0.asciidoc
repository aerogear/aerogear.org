Functionality Details
---------------------

Each primary functional area has its own requirements, roadmap, and use-case document.  These are linked below, and can be seen visually in this diagram:

image:img/aerogear_overview.jpeg[AeroGear Overview]

Each client library will have requirements for persistence, security, messaging, sync, etc....  All common requirements across all libraries will be covered in the respective orthogonal documents.  Additionally, specific planned API and functionality for a given client library will be covered in that client libraries document.  The goal is to have little duplicate information between documents.

Document Of Record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is important to note that these documents are use-cases, roadmaps, plans, etc...  These are not final API documentation.  Each functional piece (controller, client lib, etc...) will contain its own final API documentation.  As functionality is completed parts of these documents may move to the API documentation, or be updated, but these are not the *Documents of Record* for implemented functionality.
