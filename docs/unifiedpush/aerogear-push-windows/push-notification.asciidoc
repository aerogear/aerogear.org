== Send a Push Notification


Now that we have the sample application running, it is time to use the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ for delivering a _Push Notification_ message.

=== Simple Sender

Login to the administration console of the UnifiedPush server and click on the "Send Push" icon in the navigation menu. Select the application that you created and write a message in the text field. Once done, hit the 'Send Push Notification'.

If all goes well, you should see the message payload being displayed on screen:

Now click the 'Home' button to return to Home Screen and send another push message. You should see the notification being displayed in the Notification Manager:

=== You are done

That's all you need to use the _AeroGear_ project for sending and receiving _Push Notifications_ for Windows.
