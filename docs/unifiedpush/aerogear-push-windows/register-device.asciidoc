The AeroGear UnifiedPush Server
-------------------------------

With all the Windows Setup work being done, we are now ready to setup the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server[UnifiedPush Server], so that it can be used to connect to WNS for a later message sending.

:pushplatform: Windows
include::docs/unifiedpush/include--register-app.asciidoc[]

Click the **Add Variant** button. And fill out the Windows options. You will want to use the **Package SID** and **Client Secret** from the *Windows Dev Center* in their appropriate fields.

Expand the variant card and make note of the **Variant ID** and **Secret** fields. Both will be used later when registering your installation through the Android client SDK.

Notice an _Example Installation_ link which, when clicked, reveals a screen with source code examples for the registration to the UPS, with the settings preconfigured automatically based on the current environment. A handy feature that you can refer when creating your own applications to easy the setup process.

NOTE: Clicking on the appropriate tab, you can choose between _C#_ and _Cordova_ snippet!

Visual Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The server is now configured. Let's move to Visual Studio and link:../windows-app[create an Windows application] that will use the AeroGear Windows library to connect to the UnifiedPush server and start receiving notifications.
