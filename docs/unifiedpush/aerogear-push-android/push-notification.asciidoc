Now that we have the sample application running, it is time to use the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ for delivering a _Push Notification_ message.

== Simple Sender


Login to the administration console of the UnifiedPush server and click on the "Send Push" icon in the navigation menu. Select the application that you created and write a message in the text field. Once done, hit the 'Send Push Notification'.

If all goes well, you should see the message payload being displayed on screen:

Now click the 'Home' button to return to Android Home Screen and send another push message. You should see the notification being displayed in the Notification Manager:

== You are done

That's all you need to use the _AeroGear_ project for sending and receiving _Push Notifications_ from Android.

Last-Minute Notes
-----------------
Since we interface with the Android devices via link:http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html[Google Cloud Messaging], we still have a few things to keep in mind regarding the messages we send:

- Messages can be maximum 4kb
- Messages can be link:http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/adv.html#throttling[throttled]
- Google will hold messages in queue for 28 days if the intended device is unavailable for delivery, after which they will be discarded
