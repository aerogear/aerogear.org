== Google Related Setup

Before the Chrome Packaged application is able to receive the notifications, you must authenticate yourself with Google as a developer. Luckily this is both easy and free to do, and doesn't require much set-up.

=== Registering with Google

First, we must authenticate with Google. You will need a Google Account for this. Now open the https://cloud.google.com/console[Google Cloud Console].


- If you haven't created a project, click ``Create Project'':

- Now give the new project a name:

- Once the project has been created you will see the overview screen. From there grab the project number (used later as the _Sender ID_):

Since Chrome Packaged Apps use the same _Google Cloud Messaging for Android APIs_, we will need to enable them. To do that, navigate to +APIs & auth+ > +APIs+ and scroll down to the _Google Cloud Messaging for Android item, which you need to turn on:

Now we need to register our application and state that we are accessing the Google APIs from a _Web Server_, the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ in this case. First go to +APIs & auth+ > +Credentials+ and inside of the _Public API access_ area click the blue *CREATE NEW KEY* button. This launches the following popup, where you select the +Server key+ option:

On the next screen we just click the blue +Create+ button to create our Server Key:

- For extra security, you may whitelist an IP address (or multiple) for the sending server

On the last screen we are finally get to see the actual value of the generated Server Key, which we will use later:

Now that Google is ready to accept and deliver our messages, we are ready to setup the link:../register-device[UnifiedPush server].
