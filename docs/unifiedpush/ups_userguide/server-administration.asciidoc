Administration of the UnifiedPush Server
----------------------------------------

The UnifiedPush Server is protected by the link:http://keycloak.org[Keycloak SSO server]. This document explains a few features from the **Keycloak Admin Console** to perform some administrative configurations around the UnifiedPush Server and its users.

Login and Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After exploring the UnifiedPush Server's AdminUI it is time to become familiar with the _Keycloak Admin Console_, which is located at:

+http(s)://SERVER:PORT/auth/admin/aerogear/console/index.html+

After a successful login, using your admin account, you see an overview of general settings:

image::./img/kc/LandingPage_KC_Admin.png[General Settings]

WARNING: Do _**not**_ disable, rename or even delete the +aerogear+ realm. This will make the UnifiedPush Server _unusable_.

Besides the general overview, the _Keycloak Admin Console_ offers various configuration settings, such as _Login_, _Roles_, _Default Roles_, _Credentials_, _Keys_, _Email_, _Themes_ or
_Cache Config_.

NOTE: In this guide we cover only those that are relevant for the UnifiedPush Server

For instance, in the _Login Settings_ you can tweak the actual login to the UnifiedPush Server, like enabling a _Remember Me_ checkbox:

image::./img/kc/RememberMe_enabling.png[Enable RememberMe]

This will result in a slightly different login screen for the UnifiedPush Server, where a _Remember Me_ checkbox is presented underneath the +password+ field:

Another item that could be configured is the _Forgot password_ function, if one of your users (link:#_user_management[see below]) forgot its password. However, this requires configuration details for your own SMTP server, to enable Keycloak sending emails to your users:

User Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add new users that are allowed to use the UnifiedPush Server, you need to go to the +Users+ section of the _Keycloak Admin Console_:

image::./img/kc/User_overview.png[User Management Overview]

To see a list of all existing users of the UnifiedPush Server, click on the +View all users+ link:

image::./img/kc/Users_list.png[List of existing Users]

However, for adding a new user, you need to click the +Add User+ button in the above screen, which brings you to the _Add User_ form:

image::./img/kc/User_add.png[Add new User]

In this dialog you provide the information such as email or first and last name. However, the username is a mandatory field.

NOTE: Please ensure you keep the user enabled, otherwise a login is not possible.

Once you click +Save+, the screen reloads and the unique user ID is visible:

image::./img/kc/User_added.png[Added new User]

Next you can give the new user a temporary password. This option is provided in the +Credentials+ option:

image::./img/kc/User_tmp_password.png[Provide a temporary password]

Once you entered the initial (or temporary) password, you need to confirm the _reset_:

image::./img/kc/User_tmp_password_confirm.png[Confirm temporary password]

NOTE: The password of any user can be resetted all the time, using this feature. Afterwards the user is asked to update the password you used in the above dialog!

On the +Role Mappings+ option you must assign the required role to the new created user:

image::./img/kc/User_role_config.png[Select the required admin role]

The only available and required role is the +admin+ role, which you need to select on the +Available Roles+ list. Once selected, shuffle it over to the +Assigned Roles+ list:

image::./img/kc/User_role_configured.png[Configured role settings]

NOTE: Using the shuffle component automatically saves the selection!

At this point the new user is able to use the UnifiedPush Server.

In the +Sessions+ option you can monitor the active sessions of a specific user:

image::./img/kc/User_sessions_overview.png[Active sessions of a specific user]

This dialog allows you to +logout+ a specific session of the user, or all using the +Logout All Sessions+ button above the table.

Active Sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the +Sessions and Tokens+ section of the _Keycloak Admin Console_ you can monitor all active session against the UnifiedPush Server's realm, as well as providing configurations around access tokens or timeouts.

The +Realm Sessions+ option allows you to perform a logout for _all_ active sessions:

image::./img/kc/Session_Tokens_overview.png[All active sessions]

On the +Timeout Settings+ option you can override the default settings for session timeouts or different token lifespans:

image::./img/kc/Session_Timeout_Settings.png[Timeout configuration]

NOTE: For security reasons the default timeout values for the UnifiedPush Server are pretty conservative. Becareful when increasing them!

On the +Revocation Policies+ section, you can specify the _Not-before_ revocation policies per realm, application, or user, and _push_ this value to the client adapters that have a
admin url set up:

image::./img/kc/Session_Revocation_Policies.png[Revocation Policies]


By default +Brute Force Protection+ is disabled. You can enable it, using the highlighted button:

image::./img/kc/Session_Enable_BruteForce.png[Enable Brute Force]

With _Brute Force Protection_ enabled your UnifiedPush Server gains more security features. The above form gives options to configure different times and options for attempts to perform a login, and how often.

SSL by default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the option "Require SSL" on Keycloak is enabled to make sure that UnifiedPush will run under SSL, except for *localhost* and *Docker* images. If you are deploying UPS on non-SSL environment, an exception like "*request scheme: http ssl required*" is expected.

Next Steps
~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you are familiar with the two admin user interfaces of the UnifiedPush Server, it is time to get some mobile development started! You can find a list of different tutorials and guides link:../next[here].
