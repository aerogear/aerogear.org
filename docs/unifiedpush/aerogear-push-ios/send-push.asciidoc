Now you have the Sample App running on your phone, so it is time to use the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ for delivering a _Push Notification_ message to your device!

== Simple Sender

Login to the administration console of the UnifiedPush server and click on the "Send Push" icon in the navigation menu. Select the application that you created and write a message in the text field. Once done, hit the 'Send Push Notification'.

When the application is inactive, and a Push Notification containing the alert key is received by the device, a Popup will show up, which displays the value of the alert key:

== Custom Dialog

While the application is running in foreground, the above described feature is _NOT_ available. However, a different callback can be implemented on the _AppDelegate_ class:

[source,c]
----
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo {

    // A JSON object is received, represented as a NSDictionary.
    // use it to pick your custom key
    
    // For demo reasons, we simply read the "alert" key, from the "aps" dictionary:
    NSString *alertValue = [userInfo valueForKeyPath:@"aps.alert"];
    
    
    UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc]
                          initWithTitle: @"Custom Dialog, while Program is active"
                          message: alertValue
                          delegate: nil
                          cancelButtonTitle:@"OK"
                          otherButtonTitles:nil];
    [alert show];
}
----

The _application didReceiveRemoteNotification:_ method receives a _NSDictionary_ which represents a _JSON_ map, of the received payload. The _aps_ field of that map contains all the received attributes, like the earlier mentioned _alert_ key/value pair. The show code simply reads the value of the _alert_ key and explicitly displays it in a custom dialog. Of course, based on the needed functionality it would be also possible to update a view, based on the received message.


The custom Dialog:

=== Custom Keys

Besides reading the standard keys, like +alert+ the UnifiedPush Server supports custom keys, which could have an application specific meaning. Reading the value of your own keys is as simple as in the above snippet about the custom dialog:

[source,c]
----
NSString *customValue = [userInfo valueForKeyPath:@"customKey"];
----

Now the evaluated value can be used inside of the iOS application.

== iOS 7

In iOS 7 there is a new callback which, in addition to the normal foreground processing, allows the application to process messages while it is running in the background.

_Note:_ *If your application has _no_ need for background processing, using the above method is recommended.*

[source,c]
----
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler {

    // 'userInfo' contains information related to the remote notification.

    // should always be called at the end of processing so
    // the system can take a UI snapshot of the application.
    completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData);
}
----

Using this method, the iOS platform processes the notification and launches the application in the background. This helps to shrink the time between seeing a push notification and displaying the actual data in the iOS application, as the download of the data for the push notification (if really needed) starts in the background as well.

=== Enabling Background Notifications

In order to get background processing for push notifications to work you have to open your Applications' +Info.plist+ file:

image:./img/InfoPlist.png[Info.plist file of the Application]

and include the following XML:

[source,c]
----
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
----

=== Sending Notifications for Background Processing

To ensure that your message is really received by our application when it is in background mode, you need to include the "content-available" flag into your message payload.

NOTE: If you are using the link:http://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/GetStartedwithJavaSender/[Java Sender] to send push notifications on the server side, simply call _".contentAvailable()"_ when building the message payload. Check the documentation link:http://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/GetStartedwithJavaSender/#_ios_specific_payload[here]  for more details.

== iOS 8

iOS 8 provides support for interactive notifications. To utilise it, follow these steps:

* add extra payload +"action-category"+ in server side notification
* add category in your client app with the same name as the one in payload 
* add action button logic

If you want a complete example that demo's interactive notification refer to link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-aerodoc-ios/[AeroDoc].

=== Sending interactive notifications : extra payload

All you need to do is include +"action-category":"YOUR_ACTION_NAME"+ into your message payload

NOTE: If you are using the link:http://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/GetStartedwithJavaSender/[Java Sender] to send push notifications on the server side, simply call _".actionCategory()"_ when building the message payload. Check the documentation link:http://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/GetStartedwithJavaSender/#_ios_specific_payload[here]  for more details.

_Note:_ APNs interactive notification adds +category+ to its payload to associate a group of actions to a category of notification. As UPS already uses the name 'categories' in its payload but for a different purpose, the name 'action-category' was chosen instead.

=== Receiving interactive notifications : add category
When registering for remote notification, provide a category. To define a category, add all associated actions. Here we demo only action but you can define a list. 

Depending on your notification setup, the list of visible actions can be limited. Using _UIUserNotificationActionContextMinimal_ you can define which actions should be displayed in priority when space is limited.

[source,c]
----
- (UIMutableUserNotificationCategory*)registerActions {
    UIMutableUserNotificationAction* action = [[UIMutableUserNotificationAction alloc] init];
    action.identifier = @"YOUR_ACTION_NAME";
    action.title = @"YOUR_ACTION_NAME";
    action.activationMode = UIUserNotificationActivationModeForeground;
    action.destructive = false;
    action.authenticationRequired = false;
    
    UIMutableUserNotificationCategory* category = [[UIMutableUserNotificationCategory alloc] init];
    category.identifier = @"YOUR_CATEGORY_NAME";
    [category setActions:@[action] forContext: UIUserNotificationActionContextDefault];
    return category;
}
----

Once all actions are defined and wrapped into a category, add category to _UIUserNotificationSettings_ as shown below:

[source,c]
----
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

// when running under iOS 8 we will use the new API for APNS registration
#if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED >= 80000
  if ([application respondsToSelector:@selector(registerUserNotificationSettings:)]) {    
    UIUserNotificationCategory* category = [self registerActions];
    NSMutableSet* categories = [NSMutableSet set];
    [categories addObject:category];
    UIUserNotificationSettings* notificationSettings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound categories:categories];
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];
} else {
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes: (UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound | UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert)];
    }    
#else
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes: (UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound | UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert)];
#endif
----

=== Dealing with interactive notifications : add action

When an action has been selected in the interactive push notification, the callback _application:handleActionWithIdentifier:forRemoteNotification:completionHandler:_ is called. To implement your action you need to check on which action was chosen:

[source,c]
----
#if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED >= 80000
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application handleActionWithIdentifier:(NSString *)identifier forRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo completionHandler:(void(^)())completionHandler {
    if([identifier isEqualToString: @"YOUR_ACTION_NAME"]) {
      ...
      ...
    }
    completionHandler();
}
#endif
----

== You are done

That's all you need to use the _AeroGear_ project for sending, and receiving _Push Notifications_ for an iOS device.

=== A final note

When using _Push Notifications_, have in mind that it's more for signaling and once in a while notifying a client. The app has to, by Apple's guidelines, function without receving _Push Notifications_. _Remember:_ The user could have disagreed after installing your app!
