Creating a Provisioning Profile
-------------------------------

Now that you have created an App ID and you got your SSL certificate, it's time to create a _Provisioning Profile_

Development Provisioning Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the _Provisioning Portal_ you need to create an _iOS App Development_ provisioning profile, so that you can test the Push Notifications on your own iOS devices:

Now, select the _App ID_, that you created earlier:

Select your Developer Certificate:

Select a _Test_ Device, this is usually your phone, which is already known by Xcode:

Give it a Profile Name and generate it:

Now download the Profile and open the file. Go to Xcode -> preferences... menu, select the "Account" tab, on the right bottom corner click "View details..." and you should see your provisioning profile:

Distribution Provisioning Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to test Push Notifications on a *production environment*, you need to create an _iOS App Distribution_ provisioning profile in the _Provisioning Portal_.

Select your Developer Certificate:

You still need a _test device_ to try your _production_ app with your _distribution provisioning profile_. Select a _Test_ Device, this is usually your phone, which is already known by Xcode:

Give it a Profile Name and generate it:

Now download the Profile and open the file. Go to Xcode -> preferences... menu, select the "Account" tab, on the right bottom corner click "View details..." and you should see your provisioning profile:
