title: The AeroGear UnifiedPush Server
---


The _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ defines logical _abstraction_ for Mobile Applications that have support for different Push Networks. It's _Push Applications_ can have different "Variants". For this tutorial we need to create a _Push Application_ which will contain the _SimplePush_ variant. Details on the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server are discussed link:http://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/[here].

:pushplatform: SimplePush
include::docs/unifiedpush/include--register-app.asciidoc[]

Time to register our SimplePush Variant. Click on the **Add Variant** button

Fill in a _name_ and a _description_ and choose the _SimplePush_ option from the list of available variant types.

Notice an _Example Installation_ link which, when clicked, reveals a screen with source code examples for the registration to the UPS, with the settings preconfigured automatically based on the current environment. A handy feature that you can refer when creating your own applications to easy the setup process.
